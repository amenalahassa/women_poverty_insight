## About
International Women's Day Challenge on Zindi

This repo contains the code for the International Women's Day Challenge on Zindi. The challenge is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the % of households per ward that are female-headed and living below a particular income threshold by using data points that can be collected through other means without an intensive household survey like the census.

I first tried to build a model using the data provided in the challenge. And also do some data analysis to understand the data better.

### Next
- Add version to each submission
- Use the current model as baseline
- Plot feature importance
- Try current best models with all baseline features
- Do better feature engineering with tensorflow
- Try deep learning models

## Analysis
- Can we predict the % of households per ward
- Can we predict if it is rural or urban 
- Can we cluster the wards based on the data provided and see if the clusters are meaningful
