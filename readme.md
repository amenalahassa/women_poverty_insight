## About
International Women's Day Challenge on Zindi

This repo contains the code for the International Women's Day Challenge on Zindi. The challenge is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the % of households per ward that are female-headed and living below a particular income threshold by using data points that can be collected through other means without an intensive household survey like the census.

I first tried to build a model using the data provided in the challenge. And also do some data analysis to understand the data better. 

My main intention was to build a model using Tensorflow Decision Forest. But I also tried to build a model using Yggdrasil Decision Forest and Deep Neural Network.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow DF
- YDF (Yggdrasil Decision Forest)

### Data
The data is provided by Zindi. I can't share the data here. But you can download the data from the Zindi website.
