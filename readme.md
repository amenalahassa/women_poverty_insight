International Women's Day Challenge on Zindi

This repo contains the code for the International Women's Day Challenge on Zindi. The challenge is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the % of households per ward that are female-headed and living below a particular income threshold by using data points that can be collected through other means without an intensive household survey like the census.

I first tried to build a model using the data provided in the challenge. And also do some data analysis to understand the data better.
